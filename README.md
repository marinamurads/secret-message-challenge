# Secret Message Code Challenge

## Overview
This project solves a coding challenge that involves parsing a set of Unicode characters and their corresponding positions in a 2D grid, as specified in a document. The goal is to generate and print the grid with the characters placed at the correct coordinates, while filling any unspecified positions with a space character.

## Problem Description
1. The input consists of a list of Unicode characters along with their x- and y-coordinates.
2. The grid's coordinates start from (0, 0). While there is no maximum value for the grid dimensions, all unspecified grid positions must be filled with a space character.
3. The task involves reading the input, parsing the data, and printing the characters in the correct positions to form a graphic representation of uppercase letters.
